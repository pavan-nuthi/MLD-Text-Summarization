Spain's Football Federation has initiated disciplinary action against national coach Luis Aragones over racist comments about Thierry Henry.Aragones insisted the comments, made to Henry's Arsenal club-mate Jose Antonio Reyes, were meant to motivate the player, and were not intended to be offensive.England's players made a point of wearing anti-racism t-shirts when training before their friendly against Spain in Madrid last month.But the storm increased following racist chanting by Spanish fans at England's black players during the game, which Spain won 1-0.
