Kelly Holmes and the 4x100m boys' victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the British team.We should be concerned that we're not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level.                                     Kelly Holmes was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality.Kelly had been full of "should I, shouldn't I?" thoughts about going for the double in Athens. ________________________
