Eight protesters who stormed the House of Commons chamber during a debate on the Hunting Bill have been charged with disorderly conduct.Five of the men held an impromptu news conference outside Charing Cross Police Station on Monday evening, after the charges were formerly put to them.The men were arrested in September after bursting into the chamber causing a hunting ban debate to be halted.Last week, the Countryside Alliance said more than 250 hunts would meet legally the day after the ban on hunting with dogs comes into force.The other protesters are John Holliday, 37, a huntsman from Ledbury, Herefordshire, Robert Thame,
