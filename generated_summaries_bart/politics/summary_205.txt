Archbishop Desmond Tutu has called for the release of the remaining inmates at Guantanamo Bay and terror suspects detained without trial in the UK.Referring to the detentions in Cuba, Archbishop Tutu told BBC News: "It is utterly unacceptable.The UK is in order to ensure that those who have power don't use their power arbitrarily and every person retains their human rights until you have proven conclusively that so-and-so is in fact guilty."We in South Africa used to have a dispensation that detained people without trial and the world quite rightly condemned that as unacceptable.But the Home Office defended the measures.
