House prices fell further in November and property sale times lengthened as rate rises took their toll, the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors found.A total of 48% of chartered surveyor estate agents reported lower prices in the three months to November - the highest level in 12 years.The figures support recent data from the government and other bodies which all point to a slowdown in the housing market.RICS housing spokesman Ian Perry said the average asking price of a home fell by more than £600 from £190,329 in November to £189,733 in December.
