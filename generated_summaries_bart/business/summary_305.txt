According to Andreas Adriano of Latin Trade Magazine, the new bankruptcy law will help in reducing the spread - difference between the interest rates of the banks and federal bonds.The bill, proposed in 1993, has finally been approved by the leadership of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.The old law, dating from 1945, gave priority first to workers, second to tax revenue and finally to creditors.Mr Adriano said to reduce the basic interest rate the Central Bank needs to change its policy, focusing not only on inflation but also on economic growth.
