The European Parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented.The bill was backed by some hi-tech firms, saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile.But opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation, be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement.Politicians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law.During consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped.
