Yukos is claiming more than $20bn (£11bn) in damages after Yugansk was sold in December to settle back taxes. To settle the bill, Russia forced Yukos to sell off Yuganskneftegas. Rosneft, meanwhile, has agreed to merge with Gazprom, bringing a large chunk of Russia's very profitable oil business back under state control.
