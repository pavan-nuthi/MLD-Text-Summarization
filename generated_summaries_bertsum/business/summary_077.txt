The Kremlin said on Tuesday that the $6bn which Russian state bank VEB lent state-owned Rosneft to help buy Yugansk in turn came from Chinese banks. Rosneft and VEB declined to comment. The deal between Rosneft and CNPC is seen as part of China's desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy.
