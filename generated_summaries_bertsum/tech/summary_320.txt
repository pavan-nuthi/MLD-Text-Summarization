Sony, IBM and Toshiba, who have been working on the Cell processor for three years, unveiled the chip on Monday. IBM has said it will sell a workstation with the chip starting later this year. Initial devices are unlikely to be any smaller than a games console, however, because the first version of the Cell will run hot enough to need a cooling fan.
