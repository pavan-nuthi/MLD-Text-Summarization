Tory spokesman David Davis told MPs the UK was losing its power of veto over who was allowed to come to Britain. "By confusing the country it hopes no one will notice the disappearance of the asylum and immigration veto." The 25 member-states are expected to scrap the requirement for unanimous agreement on immigration policy, in favour of the qualified majority voting (QMV) system.
