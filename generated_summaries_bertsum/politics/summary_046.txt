Mr Blunkett's conduct is being looked at to establish whether he abused his position in relation to his ex-lover. Mr Howard said Mr Blunkett had complained he had inherited a "giant mess" when he took over at the Home Office from Jack Straw, now foreign secretary. Last week, Mr Blunkett won the first round of a High Court battle with Mrs Quinn for access to her son.
