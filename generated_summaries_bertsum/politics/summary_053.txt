Viktor Makarov, 50, claims he has been betrayed by the British authorities, who promised he would live like an "average British citizen". Oleg Gordievsky, a senior KGB officer who became a secret agent for the British, said he was "very happy" with the way the government have treated him since him since he defected in 1985. Through his English teacher, he made an approach to M16 - and then began passing secrets to the British intelligence service.
